"""Tic Tac Toe reusable game engine package.

This package exposes a small, wellâ€‘typed public API for building multiple
front ends (console, desktop GUI, browser via PyScript) atop a shared
pure Python core. The internal structure is intentionally simple:

Layers:
	logic: Domain models, validation rules, search (minimax)
	game:  Orchestration layer (engine loop, player & renderer abstractions)

Only stable, documented symbols are exported via ``__all__`` below.
